# Aguas_gipuzkoa_clustering

The main goal of the task was clustering the villages in my home-region Gipuzkoa (Basque Country) based on their water consumption characteristics to uncover underlying patterns or similarities as well exploring the trends and patterns in water consumption over different trimesters.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization of volume and performance metrics, and feature engineering for clustering.
